# Machine_Learning_House_Price_Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. A linear regression model is used to find the relationship between these features and the house price. The model is trained on a dataset of house prices and then evaluated to predict future prices accurately.

Key steps include:

1.Data preprocessing and cleaning
2.Feature selection
3.Training the linear regression model
4.Model evaluation and predictions
